# The intro
-- someone is waving at you --  
"Oh! Hello! Please feel free to check any book (project) you like. Note that as per today, the codes are relatively simple and, I hope, easy to follow."  
-- just a moment to contemplate the fireplace (weird that this is happening in a library) --  
"Please, if, anyhow, you want to propose an update or an improvement, feel free to do so. I am learning as much as I can although tips and recommendations are always welcome."
