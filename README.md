# Welcome 
Hello! Please feel free to check any project you like. Note that as per today, the codes are relatively simple and, I hope, easy to follow.  
Please, if, anyhow, you want to propose an update or an improvement, feel free to do so. I am learning as much as I can although tips and recommendations are always welcome.  

## Python
This repository, currently, has the following small programs:
- Password generator and storage.
- Flash Cards: A game to learn Spanish.
- Turtle Crossing: Reach higher levels reaching the other side of the big road.
- Dataframe Check: Class to do some basic first checks to a set of data in Pandas.

Help to other members' repositories:

## HTML/CSS
